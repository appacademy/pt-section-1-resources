## Basic setup for pairing

**_Important:_ First determine who will create the repo on GitHub as the  
instructions for each partner will be different.**

### Creating a Repo

- Create a repository on github by pressing the new button in the top left corner of  
your github homepage

  ![newButton](./newButton.JPG)

- Name your repository and be sure to set it to private, also don't press any of the check boxes

  ![createRepo](./createRepo.JPG)

- Connect your local git repository
  - Once you have created a repository it will bring you to a page with directions for setup
  - Recommended: Create a new local repository by entering these commands one line at a  
  time in the directory that you wish to become a git repository

  ![createNew](./createNew.JPG)

  - Alternative: If you already have a repository set up that you want to push up follow these  
  commands one line at a time

  ![pushExisting](./pushExisting.JPG)

- Once you have followed all the commands refresh your github and you should see something  
similar to this

  ![pushedUp](./pushedUp.JPG)

- Invite your partner
  - While on the page for the new repo click the settings cog above it should take you to  
  something that looks like this

    ![inviteCollaborator](./inviteCollaborator.JPG)

  - Click on Invite Collaborator and search your partner's github username

    ![addClassmates](./addClassmates.JPG)

- Lastly, your cohort is your most valuable resource during a/A make sure to follow each other  
on github to make it easier to share projects and work together!

### Cloning a Repo

- Once your pair has created a repository and invited you, you should receive an email  
on the account you linked when you created your github
- After you have accepted the invite in your email you should be redirected to  
something that looks like this  
![invite](./acceptInvite.JPG)
- After accepting the invitation you will be redirected to the github repository  
where you can copy the link  
![copyLink](./copyLink.JPG)
- Inside the directory you want to copy the project into run the command  
*`git clone "copied-link"`*
- You should now have all of the files and directories on your local machine, don't forget  
to follow your partner on github!

## Basic git flow for pairing

Once you and your pair are set up and working on the same repository things get a lot easier. As you switch back and forth from driver to navigator you will need to follow these steps.

Steps for the driver:

- Save your work
- Type ``git status`` into your terminal, you should see something like this:

  ![gitStatus](./gitStatus.JPG)

- Type ``git add .`` in order to add all of your changes to the staging area
- Retype ``git status`` in order to confirm everything worked correctly:

  ![gitAdd](./gitAdd.JPG)

- Type ``git commit -m <meaningful_commit>`` replacing meaningful_commit with your message
- Retype ``git status`` one last time:

  ![gitCommit](./gitCommit.JPG)

- Type ``git push`` in order to send it up to GitHub:

  ![gitPush](./gitPush.JPG)

- Wait for the navigator to pull
- Begin navigating

Steps for the navigator:

- Wait for the driver to push
- Type ``git pull``
- Begin driving
