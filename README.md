Instructions for instructors to set up their cohort branch!

1. Make a new branch using main as your template
    - branch name should be `firstname-lastname/month-YYYY` i.e., `william-vincent/Oct-2023`
    - `git checkout main`
    - `git pull`
    - `git checkout -b {your branch name}`
    - `git push -u origin {your branch name}`
2. Use it to provide lecture notes to your cohort :)
