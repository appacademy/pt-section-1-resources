# Catstagram, Phase 1: Fetch A New Cat Image On Page Load

Today, you will be building out the HTML structure of the page using
JavaScript and using the Cats API to display a new cat whenever the page is
loaded.

## Setup

Download this starter repo from the GitHub repository and open it in VS Code.

Run `node app.js` from the root directory to start the server that will serve
the static assets in the practice. Navigate to [http://localhost:5000] in your
browser to see the __public/index.html__ file rendered.

## Instructions

Take some time to browse through each file. __public/index.html__ is where your
page will exist and where your scripts will inject DOM elements into.

You'll be primarily working in the __public/index.js__ file today, and at the
current moment, it's empty. Your job will be to write a `window.onload`
callback. This callback should inject the page with all the necessary elements
to match __wireframes/phase-1.png__. The image will have to be fetched from the
Cats API. Make sure you look through the [API documentation].

Don't forget to connect __index.html__ with __index.js__!

If you wish, you may also add your own flair to the styling. You can choose to
create a CSS file, use inline-styles with JavaScript, or a mix of both.
