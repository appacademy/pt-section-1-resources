- Orientation
- Student Resource Repo
- Find your why

## Orientation

We will go through the orientation slide deck as a class along with guest speakers from different parts of the program.

## Student Resource Repo and Personal Notes

The student resources repo will be where I post lecture notes and scratch files from lecture. 

We have a template on the repo for you to use as a base for your notetaking and file structure here at app academy. 

A messy file structure is absolutely miserable to work with down the line when you have a lot of different practices and projects. So we have built this to make your lives just a little bit easier!

If you get stuck due to a tech error during this demo process, stick around for office hours if you can, and we will help you get it sorted.

## Find your why

This program is challenging, long, and can be highly frustrating at times. Learning to code isn't a cakewalk. It's helpful to take note of your motivations and keep that at the forefront of your mind when the going gets tough. Really drill down and ask yourself, "Why do I want to be a software engineer?".
