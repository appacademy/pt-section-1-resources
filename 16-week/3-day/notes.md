1. **Request Domain Resolution:** The web browser/application (User) sends a request to the DNS server to resolve the domain name to an IP address.

2. **Respond with IP Address:** The DNS server responds with the IP address of the requested domain.

3. **Establish TCP Connection:** The user's system establishes a TCP connection for data transmission. This involves the TCP three-way handshake process to ensure a reliable connection.

4. **Route Data (IP Layer):** Data packets are routed through the IP layer, which handles the packet forwarding based on the IP address.

5. **HTTP Request (fetch):** An HTTP request is made through the established connection to the web server. The request includes details like the URL, optional settings (e.g., method, headers, body).

6. **HTTP Response:** The web server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, which includes the status code, headers, and the requested data.

7. **Route Data (Response):** The response data is routed back to the client through the IP layer and the established TCP connection.

8. **Close TCP Connection:** Once the data is received and processed, the TCP connection is closed.

9. **Process Response:** The client processes the response, typically by parsing the data (e.g., as JSON) and integrating it into the application as needed.

The handling of DNS, TCP, and IP involves multiple layers of the Internet protocol suite, commonly referred to as the TCP/IP model. Each layer has a distinct role in the process of transmitting data over the internet. Here's an overview of which entities or components handle DNS, TCP, and IP:

### DNS (Domain Name System)

- **Handled by DNS Servers:** DNS is handled by DNS servers, which are specialized servers responsible for translating human-readable domain names (like `www.example.com`) into IP addresses (like `192.0.2.1`) that computers use to identify each other on the network. Your internet service provider (ISP) typically provides DNS servers, but there are also public DNS servers available (such as those provided by Google, Cloudflare, etc.).

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

- **Handled by the Operating System's Network Stack:** TCP is managed by the operating system's network stack. When an application wants to establish a TCP connection, it uses the system's networking API (e.g., Berkeley sockets for UNIX-like systems) to request the opening of a connection. The network stack handles the TCP three-way handshake, data segmentation, transmission, reception, and reassembly of packets, ensuring reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network.

### IP (Internet Protocol)

- **Handled by Network Devices and the Operating System:** IP routing is managed by various network devices (such as routers and switches) and the operating system's network stack. Routers along the path from the source to the destination are responsible for making forwarding decisions based on the IP header of each packet, directing the packet through the network towards its final destination. The operating system's network stack configures the IP addressing for its network interfaces and handles the encapsulation and preparation of data for transmission according to the IP protocol.

In summary, DNS is managed by DNS servers, TCP is managed by the operating system's network stack on both the client and server ends, and IP is managed by the operating system and network devices (routers and switches) that route the data packets through the internet. Each layer works in conjunction with the others to ensure data is transmitted efficiently and accurately across the network.
